# Academic Information System (AIS) Security Enhancement Project (Use Case)

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the security features of the Academic Information System (AIS) at AP College. The focus is on implementing robust database security methodologies to protect sensitive data, manage user permissions effectively, and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Project Goals

- Implement comprehensive security measures to safeguard AIS database from threats.
- Ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance with specified security requirements.
- Enhance data protection, user access management, and auditing capabilities within the system.

## Methodologies for Database Security

### 1. Database Design and Security Architecture
- Describe the initial database architecture and identify security vulnerabilities.
- Outline the strategies and methodologies used to enhance database security.

### 2. Security Requirements and Implementation

#### 2.1 Permission Management
- **Authorization Matrix:** Define SQL roles for DB Admins, Students, and Lecturers with least privilege principles.
- **Access Control:** Implement methods used to enforce access control, including views, stored procedures, and role-based security.

#### 2.2 Data Protection
- **Data Classification:** Classify data based on sensitivity levels (e.g., personal information, academic records).
- **Encryption and Hashing:** Implement encryption mechanisms for sensitive data fields and hashing for passwords.

#### 2.3 Auditing and Logging
- **Audit Trail:** Implement logging mechanisms to record all database activities, including structural changes, data modifications, and permission changes.
- **Daily Audit Reports:** Describe how daily audit reports are generated to monitor user activities and database changes.

### 3. Documentation and Validation

#### 3.1 Data Dictionary
- Provide an updated Data Dictionary detailing database entities, attributes, and their security classifications.

#### 3.2 Testing and Validation
- **Test Cases Document:** Include SQL scripts for testing security measures and validating database functionalities (`DBS_TestCases_<group number>.docx`).
