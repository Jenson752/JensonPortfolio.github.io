# Academic Information System (AIS) Security Enhancement Project (Use Case)

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the security features of the Academic Information System (AIS) at AP College. The focus is on implementing robust database security methodologies to protect sensitive data, manage user permissions effectively, and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Project Goals

- Implement comprehensive security measures to safeguard AIS database from threats.
- Ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance with specified security requirements.
- Enhance data protection, user access management, and auditing capabilities within the system.

## Methodologies for Database Security Implementation

### Security Requirements and Implementation

### 1. Permission Management

#### 1.1 Authorization Matrix
- **Role Definitions**:
  - Define specific roles for **DB Admins**, **Students**, and **Lecturers**.
  - **DB Admins**: Manage database objects but restricted from sensitive student and lecturer data.
  - **Students**: Can view and update their personal data; cannot access others' data.
  - **Lecturers**: Manage their own details and their studentsâ€™ academic records within their subjects.

- **Least Privilege Principle**:
  - Ensure each role has only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
  - Regularly review and adjust permissions to maintain minimal access rights.

#### 1.2 Access Control
- **Role-Based Security**:
  - Use SQL Server roles to efficiently manage permissions, assigning access based on roles rather than individual users.

- **Views**:
  - Create SQL views to control and filter data access. For instance, use views to restrict students to their own records or to filter lecturer views to only their students' data.

- **Stored Procedures**:
  - Utilize stored procedures to handle complex operations securely and enforce business rules, reducing direct access to tables and enhancing security.

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
  - Implement RLS policies to restrict access to rows based on user roles or attributes, ensuring users only see data relevant to them.

### 2. Data Protection

#### 2.1 Data Classification

- **Identify Data Categories**:
  - Classify data into categories such as personal information (e.g., student names, addresses), academic records (e.g., grades, course enrollments), and administrative data (e.g., user credentials).

- **Assign Sensitivity Levels**:
  - Determine sensitivity levels (e.g., public, confidential, sensitive) for each data category based on regulatory requirements and organizational policies.

#### 2.2 Encryption 

- **Encryption**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data fields (e.g., passwords, personal information) using strong encryption algorithms like AES-256. Manage encryption keys securely and rotate them regularly.

#### 2.3 Backup and Recovery

- **Automated Backup**:
  - Schedule regular automated backups of the database to capture changes. Ensure backups are performed at specified intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to maintain data availability.

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**:
  - Define a maximum RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of 6 hours to limit data loss in case of system failure or corruption. Ensure backup frequency aligns with this objective.

- **Backup Storage**:
  - Store backups securely in a separate location or use cloud-based storage for redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.

- **Backup Validation**:
  - Regularly validate backup integrity and test restoration procedures to ensure backups are reliable and can be restored promptly when needed.


### 3. Auditing and Logging

#### Audit Trail

#### 3.1 SQL Server Built-in Auditing

- **DDL Auditing**:
  - Enable SQL Server Audit to monitor and log Data Definition Language (DDL) changes such as schema modifications (e.g., table creations, alterations, drops).
  - Configure audit specifications to capture schema changes at the server or database level.

- **Permission Changes**:
  - Utilize SQL Server Audit to track changes in database permissions, including role assignments and permission grants/restrictions.
  - Define audit actions to record permission changes for auditing and compliance purposes.

- **Login and Logout Events**:
  - Implement SQL Server Audit to capture successful and unsuccessful login attempts, as well as logout events.
  - Configure audit specifications to monitor user sessions and login activities.

#### 3.2 Trigger-based Auditing (DML Auditing)

- **Data Modification Logging**:
  - Implement triggers on critical tables to log Data Manipulation Language (DML) changes such as inserts, updates, and deletes.
  - Design trigger logic to capture before and after values of modified data into an audit table for detailed tracking and historical analysis.

### 4. testing and Validation

- [**Test Cases Document:**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTLrtkxHvd2Zuxte3WI94YkSJcX3xi_TiihFGAezLPl3Nv8wKKflRB7ikvCmEZqnQ/pub) Included SQL scripts for testing security measures and validating database functionalities.
