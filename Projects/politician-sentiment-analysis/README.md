# Politician Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

During my internship, I was assigned to a comprehensive project to analyze the sentiment surrounding politicians on Twitter for proof of concept (POC) purposes. The project **aimed** to understand both the sentiment expressed by the politicians themselves and the sentiment of the public towards them, including those who mentioned or interacted with them on Twitter. In this case, I utilized several essential tools to execute this project effectively.

## Objectives

- Data Collection: Gather tweets from selected politicians and mentions using the Twitter API and Tweepy.
- Sentiment Analysis: Employ ChatGPT APIs to classify and interpret sentiments in the tweet data.
- Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the tweet data to ensure quality and consistency.
- Visualization: Create visual representations of sentiment patterns and trends over time for politicians and their audiences.

## Methodologies

### 1. Web Scraping

#### 1.1 Extracting Politician's Tweets
